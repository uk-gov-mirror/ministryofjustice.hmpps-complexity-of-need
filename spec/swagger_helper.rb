          ### Authentication

          This API is secured by OAuth 2 with tokens supplied by HMPPS Auth.

          Read permissions are granted to any authorised client. No particular role is required.

          Write permissions are granted to clients with the role `ROLE_UPDATE_COMPLEXITY_OF_NEED`.
